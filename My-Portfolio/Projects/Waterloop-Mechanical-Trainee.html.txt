        <h1>Waterloop: Brake Component Design</h1>
        
        <h3>A. Overview</h3>
        <p>Waterloop is UWaterloo's SpaceX Hyperloop competition team. I served as a Mechanical Trainee during the 2025 development cycle.</p>

        <h3>B. Your Role</h3>
        <p>Specifically responsible for the design and manufacturing of secondary brake clamps and support brackets for the pod's deceleration system.</p>

        <div class="tech-spec">
            <h3>C. Technical Work</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CAD:</strong> Developed 3D models in Onshape ensuring 0.05mm tolerances.</li>
                <li><strong>Material:</strong> Selected 6061-T6 Aluminum for strength-to-weight ratio.</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Hands-on operation of Lathe and Milling machine; precision carbon fiber cutting.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <h3>D. Results</h3>
        <p>The final bracket assembly achieved a 12% weight reduction compared to the previous iteration while maintaining structural integrity during 2g deceleration tests.</p>

        <h3>E. Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>Design for Manufacturing (DFM) was the biggest takeaway—realizing that a "perfect" CAD model is useless if the milling bits cannot reach the internal radii.</p>
