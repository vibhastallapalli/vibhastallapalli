                        <span class="proj-hook">Designing and assembling a small embedded sensor system</span>
                        <p class="proj-desc">During exam periods, I noticed I was sitting for long periods without
                            really thinking about it, whether I was studying, scrolling on my phone, or just staying
                            seated out of habit. To push myself to take breaks and reset, I built a small sensor-based
                            device that monitors presence and provides a physical reminder through a visible LED
                            indicator. I chose to approach this as a hardware project by working with sensors,
                            microcontroller logic, and a custom enclosure rather than relying on a webcam or screen
                            notification. Having a physical device beside me, especially with a light that changes
                            state, made the reminder harder to ignore and more effective.</p>

                            <li>Designed and 3D-printed an enclosure to hold the electronics and allow easy access for

                            into usable electrical output using a small wind-driven system. The goal was not to maximize
                            efficiency, but to understand how mechanical design choices affect rotation, friction, and
                            power generation in a real build. I designed a vertical axis wind turbine, fabricated the
                            rotor components, and connected the mechanical system to a generator circuit to produce DC
                            output during testing.</p>

                        <p class="proj-desc">I was helping build an e-bike through Electrium Mobility, and I wanted to
                            understand what “good speed control” actually looks like when the load changes (like hills
                            and drag). So I built a physics simulation in C++ and wrote a discrete PID controller
                            to track step changes in target speed. I modeled basic resistive forces (aero drag + rolling
                            resistance) and added a hill/load disturbance to see how the controller reacts. Then I
                            logged results to a CSV and used Python to plot the velocity response, throttle behavior,
                            and an efficiency-vs-speed view.</p>

                            <li>Built a basic point-mass model with drag, rolling resistance, and a tunable disturbance

                            <li>Added actuator limits (0–1 throttle) and anti-windup clamping so the controller wouldn’t

                            <li>Used step changes and a disturbance force to stress-test the controller instead of only
